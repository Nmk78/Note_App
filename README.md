# 📝 Simple Note App

I started learning Expo thinking *"Hey, let's build a complex app!"* — and I did.  
Until Expo slapped me with **ads**, **build errors**, and a whole lotta **wtf moments**.  

So I said screw it — and built this **simple** offline note app.  
No logins. No cloud. Just text. Just works. 🚀
